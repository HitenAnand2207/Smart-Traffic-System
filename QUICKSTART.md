- **⚠️ Collision Alerts**: Number of high-risk collision warnings

### 5 Analysis Tabs

#### 📊 Real-Time Tab
- Current metrics snapshot
- Signal recommendations (🔴🟡🟢)
- Congestion forecast
- Emissions estimate

#### ⚠️ Alerts Tab
- Active collision risks with vehicle IDs

## 📈 Key Features Explained

### 1. Collision Detection
```
What it does:
- Tracks vehicle positions frame-by-frame
- Predicts if vehicles are on collision course
- Shows red circles and warning lines on video
- Reports risk score (0-1) for each pair

How to use:
- Adjust sensitivity slider (0.3 = very sensitive, 1.0 = conservative)
- Red circles appear when collision risk is high
- Check ⚠️ Alerts tab for details
```

### 2. Traffic Prediction
```
What it does:
- Analyzes recent traffic patterns
- Predicts congestion 30 frames (~1 second) ahead
- Detects unusual traffic events

How to use:
- Check 📈 Trends tab for forecast graph
- Look for "Anomaly" warnings
- Use predictions for signal timing
```

### 3. Heatmap Visualization
```
What it does:
- Shows traffic density as colored overlay
- Red = high congestion, Blue = light traffic
- Identifies hotspots

How to use:
- Enable in sidebar settings
- Red areas are problem zones
- Use for urban planning
```

### 4. Speed Analysis
```
What it does:
- Shows speed vector arrows on vehicles
- Calculates average fleet speed
- Generates speed distribution

How to use:
- Green arrows show direction and speed
- Longer arrows = faster vehicles
- Check 🚗 Vehicles tab for histogram
```

### 5. Incident Detection
```
What it does:
- Detects stalled vehicles
- Finds erratic driving patterns
- Identifies potential accidents

How to use:
- Check ⚠️ Alerts tab
- Severity levels: Low/Medium/High
- Use for incident response
```

## 📊 Interpreting Metrics

### Risk Index Scale
```
0-20:   ✅ LOW RISK (green)
20-50:  🟡 MODERATE RISK (yellow)
50-75:  🟠 HIGH RISK (orange)
75-100: 🔴 CRITICAL RISK (red)
```

### Congestion Levels
```
🟢 Low Traffic      → <5 vehicles
🟡 Moderate         → 5-15 vehicles
🔴 Heavy            → >15 vehicles
```

### Collision Risk Score
```
0.0-0.3: ✅ Safe
0.3-0.6: 🟡 Watch
0.6-0.8: 🟠 Caution
0.8-1.0: 🔴 High Risk
```

---

## 🔧 Customization

### Adjust Collision Sensitivity
- **Low (0.3)**: Very sensitive, detects minor risks
- **High (1.0)**: Conservative, only critical alerts
- **Recommended**: 0.6 for balanced detection

### Change Heatmap Grid Size
Edit `src/heatmap_generator.py`:
```python
generator = HeatmapGenerator(grid_size=32)  # Larger = coarser grid
```

### Calibrate Speed to Real-World Units
1. Find a known distance on your camera (e.g., road marking)
2. Measure pixels between points
3. In sidebar settings, use: `estimator.calibrate_pixels_to_meters(pixels, meters)`

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Laggy playback | Enable "Show Speed Vectors" OFF |
| Collision alerts too many | Increase sensitivity slider to 0.8 |
| App crashes with large video | Reduce resolution, process in chunks |
| YOLOv8 model not loading | Run: `pip install --upgrade ultralytics` |
| Streamlit not found | Ensure `.venv` is activated |

## 🚀 Performance Tips

### For Faster Processing
1. Disable heatmap overlay (`-heatmap`)
2. Disable trajectory display
3. Increase collision sensitivity (fewer alerts = less processing)
4. Use lower resolution videos (720p instead of 1080p)

### For Better Accuracy
1. Use well-lit traffic footage
2. Ensure good camera angle (birds-eye is best)
3. Calibrate speed estimates for accuracy
4. Process videos at consistent frame rates

### GPU Acceleration (Optional)
```bash
# For NVIDIA GPU support
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118

# Then set in code:
# model.to('cuda')
```
